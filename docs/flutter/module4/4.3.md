# Module 4, Sub-lesson 3: Working with JSON Data

In this sub-lesson, we will cover how to work with JSON data in Flutter. We will explore how to parse JSON data and convert it to Dart objects. We will also discuss some common issues related to working with JSON data and how to handle them.

JSON is a common format used to transmit data over the internet. In Flutter, we can use the dart:convert library to parse JSON data and convert it to Dart objects.

## Parsing JSON Data

When we receive JSON data from an API, we need to parse it into a format that our application can understand. In Flutter, we can use the json.decode method to parse JSON data. Here is an example of how to parse a JSON response:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<List<Post>> fetchPosts() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final parsed = json.decode(response.body).cast<Map<String, dynamic>>();
    return parsed.map<Post>((json) => Post.fromJson(json)).toList();
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load posts');
  }
}
```

In this example, we use the json.decode method to parse the JSON response into a list of Map<String, dynamic> objects. We then use the map method to convert each Map object into a Post object using the fromJson method.

## Converting JSON Data to Dart Objects

Once we have parsed JSON data, we need to convert it to Dart objects so that we can use it in our application. We can do this by creating a class that represents the data and defining a fromJson method that converts a Map object to an instance of the class.

Here is an example of how to create a Post class and a fromJson method:

```dart
class Post {
  final int id;
  final String title;
  final String body;
  final int userId;

  Post({this.id, this.title, this.body, this.userId});

  factory Post.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Post(
      id: json['id'],
      title: json['title'],
      body: json['body'],
      userId: json['userId'],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a Post class with four properties: id, title, body, and userId. We then define a fromJson method that takes a Map object and creates a new instance of the Post class using the values from the Map.

## Handling Errors and Exceptions

When working with JSON data, we may encounter errors or exceptions. For example, the JSON data may not be in the expected format, or it may be missing required fields. To handle these issues, we should validate the JSON data before trying to parse it and handle any errors that may occur.

Here is an example of how to validate JSON data before parsing it:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<Post> fetchPost(int id) async {
  final response = await http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/$id');

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final parsed = json.decode(response.body);
    if (parsed is Map<String, dynamic>) {
      return Post.fromJson(parsed);
    } else {
      throw Exception('Invalid JSON format');
    }
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load post');
  }
}
```

In this example, we check if the parsed JSON data is a `Map<String, dynamic>` object before trying to create a Post object. If it is not a Map object, we throw an exception. This helps us avoid runtime errors related to null values or missing fields.

## Conclusion

In this sub-lesson, we have covered how to work with JSON data in Flutter. We have explored how to parse JSON data and convert it to Dart objects. We have also discussed some common issues related to working with JSON data and how to handle them. By understanding how to work with JSON data, you can easily integrate external APIs into your Flutter applications and build robust and reliable applications that are able to handle errors and exceptions appropriately.
