# Module 4, Sub-lesson 7: Handling Errors and Exceptions in Networking and Persistence

In this sub-lesson, we will cover how to handle errors and exceptions when working with networking and persistence in your Flutter application. We will explore different types of errors and how to handle them effectively in your application.

## Handling Network Errors

When making HTTP requests to APIs or other external sources, it is important to handle network errors effectively. Network errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a loss of network connectivity, server errors, or timeouts.

In Flutter, we can use the http package to make HTTP requests to APIs. Here is an example of how to handle network errors:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<List<Post>> fetchPosts() async {
  try {
    final response = await http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      final parsed = json.decode(response.body).cast<Map<String, dynamic>>();
      return parsed.map<Post>((json) => Post.fromJson(json)).toList();
    } else {
      throw Exception('Failed to load posts');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to load posts: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a try/catch block to catch any network errors that may occur. If the request is successful, we parse the JSON response and return a list of Post objects. If the request fails, we throw an exception with an error message.

## Handling Persistence Errors

When working with local storage options such as shared preferences or SQLite, it is also important to handle persistence errors effectively. Persistence errors can occur for a variety of reasons, such as disk space limitations or corrupt data.

In Flutter, we can use different local storage options, and each of them has their own way of handling errors. Here is an example of how to handle errors when using shared preferences:

```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<void> savePosts(List<Post> posts) async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final encoded = json.encode(posts.map((post) => post.toJson()).toList());
    await prefs.setString('posts', encoded);
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to save posts: $e');
  }
}

Future<List<Post>> getPosts() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final encoded = prefs.getString('posts');
    if (encoded != null) {
      final parsed = json.decode(encoded).cast<Map<String, dynamic>>();
      return parsed.map<Post>((json) => Post.fromJson(json)).toList();
    } else {
      return [];
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to load posts: $e');
  }
}
```

In this example, we use a try/catch block to catch any persistence errors that may occur. If saving or retrieving data is successful, we proceed as usual. If an error occurs, we throw an exception with an error message.

## Conclusion

In this sub-lesson, we have covered how to handle errors and exceptions when working with networking and persistence in your Flutter application. We have explored different types of errors and how to handle them effectively in your application. By understanding how to handle errors and exceptions, you can build robust and reliable applications that are able to handle unexpected situations and provide a better user experience.
