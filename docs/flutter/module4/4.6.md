# Module 4, Sub-lesson 6: Working with SQLite in Flutter

In this sub-lesson, we will explore how to work with SQLite in Flutter. SQLite is a lightweight and fast database engine that is commonly used in mobile applications to store structured data.

## Working with SQLite

Flutter provides the `sqflite` package for working with SQLite databases. Here is an example of how to create a database and a table using `sqflite`:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

Future<Database> openDatabase() async {
  final dbPath = await getDatabasesPath();
  final path = join(dbPath, 'my_database.db');
  return openDatabase(path, onCreate: (db, version) async {
    await db.execute('CREATE TABLE posts(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT)');
  }, version: 1);
}
```

In this example, we use the getDatabasesPath method to retrieve the path to the application's database directory. We then use the openDatabase method to create a new database or open an existing one. In the onCreate callback, we create a new table called posts.

Here is an example of how to insert data into the posts table:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> insertPost(Post post) async {
  final db = await openDatabase();
  await db.insert('posts', post.toMap(), conflictAlgorithm: ConflictAlgorithm.replace);
}
```

In this example, we use the insert method to insert a new row into the posts table. We pass the Post object as a map using the toMap method.

Here is an example of how to query the posts table:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<List<Post>> getPosts() async {
  final db = await openDatabase();
  final maps = await db.query('posts');
  return List.generate(maps.length, (i) {
    return Post(
      id: maps[i]['id'],
      title: maps[i]['title'],
    );
  });
}
```

In this example, we use the query method to retrieve all rows from the posts table. We then use the List.generate method to convert the list of maps to a list of Post objects.

## Working with Models

In order to work with SQLite databases effectively in Flutter, it is important to define models that represent the tables in the database. Here is an example of how to define a Post model:

```dart
class Post {
  int id;
  String title;

  Post({this.id, this.title});

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'title': title,
    };
  }

  factory Post.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
    return Post(
      id: map['id'],
      title: map['title'],
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a Post class with an id and title property. We also define a toMap method that converts a Post object to a map, and a fromMap factory constructor that creates a Post object from a map.

## Conclusion

In this sub-lesson, we have explored how to work with SQLite in Flutter. We have covered how to create databases and tables, how to insert and retrieve data, and how to define models that represent the tables in the database. By understanding how to work with SQLite, you can build robust and reliable applications that are able to store and retrieve structured data efficiently. It is important to note that while SQLite is a powerful and lightweight database engine, it may not be suitable for all use cases. For larger applications with complex data models, you may need to consider other database options such as Firebase Realtime Database or PostgreSQL.

In conclusion, SQLite is a powerful database engine that is commonly used in mobile applications. In Flutter, we can use the `sqflite` package to work with SQLite databases. By understanding how to work with SQLite, you can build robust and efficient applications that are able to store and retrieve structured data.
