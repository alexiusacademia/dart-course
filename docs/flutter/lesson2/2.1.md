# Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Flutter Widgets

In this sub-lesson, we will introduce you to Flutter widgets, the building blocks of a Flutter UI. We will cover the difference between stateless and stateful widgets, and how to build a basic widget tree in Flutter. We will also provide real-world code examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## Stateless vs. Stateful Widgets

In Flutter, widgets can be either stateless or stateful. Stateless widgets are immutable and do not have any internal state. They are used to display static content that does not change over time. Stateful widgets, on the other hand, have mutable state that can change over time. They are used to display dynamic content that can be updated based on user input or other events.

Example Code:

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MyApp',
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MyApp'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a stateful widget, MyHomePage, that displays a counter that can be incremented by tapping a floating action button. We use the setState method to update the counter and trigger a rebuild of the widget tree.

## Building a Basic Widget Tree

In Flutter, widgets are arranged in a tree structure, with each widget having a parent and one or more children. The parent widget determines the layout and positioning of its children widgets. To build a basic widget tree in Flutter, you can use the Container widget as the parent widget, and add child widgets inside it.

Example Code:

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MyApp',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MyApp'),
        ),
        body: Container(
          child: Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('Hello'),
              Text('World'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a stateless widget, MyApp, that displays two text widgets inside a Column widget, which is the child widget of a Container widget. The Column widget arranges the two text widgets vertically, and the Container widget provides padding around the Column widget.
