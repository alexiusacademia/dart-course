# Lesson 2.3: Flutter Layout Widgets

In this sub-lesson, we will cover Flutter layout widgets. Layout widgets are used to arrange other widgets on the screen. Flutter provides a set of pre-built layout widgets that can be used to create responsive and adaptive UIs. We will cover some of the most commonly used layout widgets, including Box, Column, Row, Expanded, Flexible, Stack, and Positioned. We will also provide real-world code examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## Box

The Box widget is a basic layout widget that provides a rectangular container for other widgets. The Box widget can be used to add padding, margin, and a background color to other widgets.

Example Code:

```dart
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
  margin: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
  color: Colors.grey,
  child: Text('Hello World'),
),
```

In the example code above, we have a Container widget that provides padding, margin, and a grey background color to a Text widget.

## Column and Row

The Column and Row widgets are used to arrange other widgets vertically and horizontally, respectively. These widgets can be used to create simple layouts that stack widgets on top of each other or lay them out side-by-side.

Example Code:

```dart
Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('First'),
    Text('Second'),
    Text('Third'),
  ],
),
```

In the example code above, we have a Column widget that arranges three Text widgets vertically, with each text widget on a new line.

## Expanded and Flexible

The Expanded and Flexible widgets are used to allow widgets to grow and shrink dynamically based on the available space. These widgets can be used to create responsive and adaptive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.

Example Code:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Flexible(
      flex: 1,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        height: 100.0,
      ),
    ),
    Expanded(
      flex: 2,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        height: 100.0,
      ),
    ),
  ],
),
```

In the example code above, we have a Row widget that contains two child widgets: a red Container widget with a flexible width and a blue Container widget with an expanded width. The Expanded widget takes up twice as much space as the Flexible widget.

## Stack and Positioned

The Stack and Positioned widgets are used to layer widgets on top of each other. These widgets can be used to create complex layouts that overlap widgets and provide a sense of depth.

Example Code:

```dart
Stack(
  children: <Widget>[
    Container(
      color: Colors.red,
      height: 200.0,
      width: 200.0,
    ),
    Positioned(
      top: 50.0,
      left: 50.0,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        height: 100.0,
        width: 100.0,
      ),
    ),
  ],
),
```

In the example code above, we have a Stack widget that contains two child widgets: a red Container widget and a blue Container widget that is positioned 50 pixels from the top and left edges of the Stack widget.

## Conclusion:

In this sub-lesson, we have covered Flutter layout widgets. We have covered some of the most commonly used layout widgets, including `Box`, `Column`, `Row`, `Expanded`, `Flexible`, `Stack`, and `Positioned`. We have also provided real-world code examples to demonstrate these concepts. In the next sub-lesson, we will cover how to handle user input in Flutter, including gesture detection and form validation.
