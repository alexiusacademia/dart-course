# Lesson 2.2: Flutter Material Design Widgets

In this sub-lesson, we will cover Flutter Material Design widgets. Material Design is a design system developed by Google that provides guidelines for designing mobile and web apps. Flutter provides a set of pre-built Material Design widgets that can be used to create beautiful and functional apps. We will cover some of the most commonly used Material Design widgets, including buttons, text fields, and navigation widgets. We will also provide real-world code examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## Buttons

Buttons are a common user interface element used to trigger actions in a mobile app. Flutter provides several types of buttons, including RaisedButton, FlatButton, and OutlineButton. Each type of button has a different visual appearance and behavior.

Example Code:

```
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform some action
  },
  child: Text('Click me!'),
),
```

In the example code above, we have a RaisedButton that displays the text "Click me!" and triggers an action when pressed.

## Text Fields

Text fields are used to allow users to enter text into a mobile app. Flutter provides several types of text fields, including TextField, TextFormField, and InputDecorator. Each type of text field has different properties and behavior.

Example Code:

```
TextField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Enter your name',
  ),
),
```

In the example code above, we have a TextField that displays a label "Enter your name" and allows the user to enter text.

## Navigation Widgets

Navigation widgets are used to navigate between screens in a mobile app. Flutter provides several navigation widgets, including Navigator, AppBar, and BottomNavigationBar. These widgets provide a way to organize the app's content and make it easier for users to navigate.

Example Code:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'MyApp',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MyApp'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Welcome to MyApp'),
        ),
        bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
          items: <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
            BottomNavigationBarItem(
              icon: Icon(Icons.home),
              title: Text('Home'),
            ),
            BottomNavigationBarItem(
              icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
              title: Text('Settings'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a BottomNavigationBar widget that displays two items: "Home" and "Settings". Tapping on each item will navigate to a different screen in the app.

## Conclusion:

In this sub-lesson, we have covered Flutter Material Design widgets. We have covered some of the most commonly used Material Design widgets, including buttons, text fields, and navigation widgets. We have also provided real-world code examples to demonstrate these concepts. In the next sub-lesson, we will cover Flutter Layout widgets and how to create responsive and adaptive UIs in Flutter.
