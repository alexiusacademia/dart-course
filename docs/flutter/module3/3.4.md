# Module 3.4: Asynchronous State Management

In this sub-lesson, we will cover asynchronous state management in Flutter. We will cover working with futures and async/await, and streams and RxDart, which are two commonly used techniques for managing asynchronous state in Flutter. We will also provide real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## Futures and Async/Await

Futures and async/await are used to manage asynchronous code in Flutter. Futures represent a value that may not be available yet, while async/await is a language feature that allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

Example Code:

```dart
Future<int> fetchNumber() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  return 42;
}

class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  Future<int> _number;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _number = fetchNumber();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder<int>(
      future: _number,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          return Text('The number is ${snapshot.data}');
        } else {
          return CircularProgressIndicator();
        }
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a `fetchNumber()` function that returns a future that resolves to the number 42 after a delay of 2 seconds. The FutureBuilder widget is used to display the number once it is available.

## Streams and RxDart

Streams and RxDart are used to manage asynchronous code that produces multiple values over time. Streams represent a sequence of events, and RxDart is a library that provides reactive extensions for Dart.

Example Code:

```dart
class MyBloc {
  final StreamController<int> _controller = StreamController<int>();

  Stream<int> get countStream => _controller.stream;

  void increment() {
    _controller.add(1);
  }

  void dispose() {
    _controller.close();
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  final MyBloc _bloc = MyBloc();

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _bloc.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        StreamBuilder<int>(
          stream: _bloc.countStream,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            return Text('Count: ${snapshot.data ?? 0}');
          },
        ),
        RaisedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            _bloc.increment();
          },
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a MyBloc class that manages a stream of integers. The StreamBuilder widget is used to display the current count value, and the RaisedButton widget is used to increment the count value.

## Conclusion:

In this sub-lesson, we have covered asynchronous state management in Flutter. We have covered working with futures and async/await and streams and RxDart, which are two commonly used techniques for managing asynchronous state in Flutter. We have also provided real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts. In the next sub-lesson, we will cover state management best practices and patterns in Flutter.
