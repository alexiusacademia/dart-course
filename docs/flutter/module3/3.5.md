# Module 3.5: State Management Best Practices and Patterns

In this sub-lesson, we will cover state management best practices and patterns in Flutter. We will cover three popular patterns for managing state in Flutter: the BLoC pattern, the Provider pattern, and the Redux pattern. We will also provide real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## The BLoC Pattern

The BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern is a state management pattern that separates the UI from the business logic. The pattern involves creating a Bloc class that manages the state and exposing the state and events using streams.

Example Code:

```dart
class CounterBloc {
  final _counterController = StreamController<int>();
  Stream<int> get counterStream => _counterController.stream;
  int _counter = 0;

  void incrementCounter() {
    _counter++;
    _counterController.sink.add(_counter);
  }

  void dispose() {
    _counterController.close();
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final _bloc = CounterBloc();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        StreamBuilder<int>(
          stream: _bloc.counterStream,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            return Text('Counter: ${snapshot.data}');
          },
        ),
        RaisedButton(
          child: Text('Increment'),
          onPressed: _bloc.incrementCounter,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
    _bloc.dispose();
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a CounterBloc class that manages the state of the counter. The MyWidget class uses a StreamBuilder widget to display the current count value, and the RaisedButton widget is used to trigger an event that increments the counter.

## The Provider Pattern

The Provider pattern is a simple and scalable state management solution that uses the InheritedWidget to provide state to descendant widgets. The pattern involves creating a ChangeNotifier class that manages the state and exposing the state using a Provider widget.

Example Code:

```dart
class Counter extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final counter = Provider.of<Counter>(context);
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Counter: ${counter.count}'),
        RaisedButton(
          child: Text('Increment'),
          onPressed: counter.increment,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (_) => Counter(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

In the example code above, we have a Counter class that manages the state of the counter. The MyWidget class uses a Text widget to display the current count value, and the RaisedButton widget is used to trigger an event that increments the counter. The ChangeNotifierProvider widget is used to provide the Counter state to the MyApp widget.

## The Redux Pattern

The Redux pattern is a state management pattern that involves creating a single store that manages the state of the entire application. The pattern involves creating reducers that handle specific state changes and actions that trigger those state changes.

Example Code:

```dart
class CounterState {
  final int count;

  CounterState(this.count);

  CounterState copyWith({int count}) {
    return CounterState(count ?? this.count);
  }
}

enum CounterAction { increment }

CounterState reducer(CounterState state, action) {
  if (action == CounterAction.increment) {
    return state.copyWith(count: state.count + 1);
  }
  return state;
}

class CounterStore extends ChangeNotifier {
  CounterState _state = CounterState(0);

  CounterState get state => _state;

  void dispatch(dynamic action) {
    _state = reducer(_state, action);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final store = Provider.of<CounterStore>(context);
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Text('Counter: ${store.state.count}'),
        RaisedButton(
          child: Text('Increment'),
          onPressed: () {
            store.dispatch(CounterAction.increment);
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (_) => CounterStore(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

In the example code above, we have a CounterState class that manages the state of the counter. The reducer function is used to handle state changes based on actions. The CounterStore class uses the ChangeNotifier to manage the state of the entire application. The MyWidget class uses a Text widget to display the current count value, and the RaisedButton widget is used to trigger an action that increments the counter. The ChangeNotifierProvider widget is used to provide the CounterStore state to the MyApp widget.

In this sub-lesson, we have covered state management best practices and patterns in Flutter. We have covered three popular patterns for managing state in Flutter: the BLoC pattern, the Provider pattern, and the Redux pattern. We have also provided real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts. It is important to choose the right state management solution for your application based on its complexity and requirements.
