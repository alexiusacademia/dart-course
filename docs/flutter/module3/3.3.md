# Module 3.3: Advanced State Management Techniques

In this sub-lesson, we will cover advanced state management techniques in Flutter. We will cover the Provider and Bloc packages, which are two popular packages used for advanced state management in Flutter. We will also provide real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts.

## Provider

The Provider package is a state management solution that uses the InheritedWidget and BuildContext to share state between widgets. Provider is designed to be easy to use and can be used for small and large applications.

Example Code:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Provider<int>.value(
      value: 42,
      child: Consumer<int>(
        builder: (context, value, child) {
          return Text('The answer is $value');
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a Provider widget that provides an integer value of 42 to its child widgets. The Consumer widget is used to listen to changes in the value and update the UI accordingly.

## Bloc

The Bloc package is a state management solution that uses the Stream and Sink APIs to manage state. Bloc is designed to be highly scalable and can be used for complex applications.

Example Code:

```dart
class MyBloc extends Bloc<MyEvent, MyState> {
  @override
  MyState get initialState => MyState.initial();

  @override
  Stream<MyState> mapEventToState(
    MyEvent event,
  ) async* {
    if (event is MyEventIncrement) {
      yield state.copyWith(count: state.count + 1);
    }
  }
}

class MyState {
  final int count;

  const MyState({
    @required this.count,
  });

  factory MyState.initial() {
    return MyState(count: 0);
  }

  MyState copyWith({
    int count,
  }) {
    return MyState(
      count: count ?? this.count,
    );
  }
}

abstract class MyEvent {}

class MyEventIncrement extends MyEvent {}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final MyBloc bloc = BlocProvider.of<MyBloc>(context);
    return Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        BlocBuilder<MyBloc, MyState>(
          builder: (context, state) {
            return Text('Count: ${state.count}');
          },
        ),
        RaisedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            bloc.add(MyEventIncrement());
          },
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In the example code above, we have a MyBloc class that manages the state of the app. The BlocBuilder widget is used to listen to changes in the state and update the UI accordingly. The RaisedButton widget triggers an event that is handled by the MyBloc class to update the state.

## Conclusion:

In this sub-lesson, we have covered advanced state management techniques in Flutter. We have covered the Provider and Bloc packages, which are two popular packages used for advanced state management in Flutter. We have also provided real-world examples to demonstrate these concepts. In the next sub-lesson, we will cover asynchronous state management in Flutter, including working with futures and streams.
