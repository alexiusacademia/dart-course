# Module 1: Introduction to Dart

<br/>

## Overview

Dart is a modern, open-source programming language that was created by Google in 2011. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, making it an ideal choice for developing web, mobile, and desktop applications. Dart is a statically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at compile-time, rather than runtime. This makes it easier to catch errors before running the code. Dart also includes features such as garbage collection, a powerful type system, and support for asynchronous programming.

## History and Evolution of Dart

Dart was first announced by Google in 2011 as a new language for web programming. It was designed to address some of the shortcomings of JavaScript, including its lack of type checking and its complicated syntax. Dart was initially intended to be used for web development, but it has since evolved to become a versatile language that can be used for a variety of applications, including mobile and desktop development. The latest version of Dart is 2.14, which was released in August 2021.

## Installation of Dart SDK

To get started with Dart programming, you will need to install the Dart SDK (Software Development Kit) on your computer. The SDK includes the Dart compiler, libraries, and tools that you need to develop Dart applications. The installation process varies depending on your operating system, but detailed instructions can be found on the official Dart website.

## Hello World Program

Let's start by creating a simple "Hello World" program in Dart. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called "hello.dart". Type the following code:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```
Save the file and navigate to the directory in your terminal or command prompt. Type the following command to run the program:

```bash
dart hello.dart
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Hello, World!
```
Congratulations! You have just created your first Dart program.

## Dart Syntax

Dart syntax is similar to other C-style programming languages such as C++, Java, and JavaScript. Some key features of the Dart syntax include:

Dart is a case-sensitive language.
Statements are terminated with a semicolon (;).
Blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces ({ }).
Dart has a variety of built-in data types, including int, double, bool, String, and more.


In the next module, we will explore data types and variables in more detail.
